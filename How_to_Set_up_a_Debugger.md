# How to Set up a debugger 

The IDE the we will be using is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), a commonly used Code Editor. _VS Code_ offers the possibility of configuring the debugger 
withing those option, one can set the debugger to scan files in your computer until it fetches the **active program** in your VS Code window. 

### Steps to Follow: 
1. In the window of a running program there is a tab called _run and debug_
2. Inside this tab, click on the <isn> configuring <language> debuggin </ins>, this will open a Json file for you to choose a debuggin tool provided by your compiler 
  -  A Json file , JavaScrip Object Notation, is a data format that is common in configuration in files like packaged. **It is neither file nor a code**. IT it's a _simple_ 
format used store and transport data. It is easy to read.
3. Inside this file we will see a set of configurations to set up one or multiple debugging tools: 
```
"tasks": [
        {
            "type": "cppbuild",
            "label": "C/C++: g++.exe build active file",
            "command": "C:\\MinGW\\bin\\g++.exe",
            "args": [
                "-fdiagnostics-color=always",
                "-g",
                "${file}",
                "-o",
                "${fileDirname}\\${fileBasenameNoExtension}.exe"
            ],
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${fileDirname}"
            },
            "problemMatcher": [
                "$gcc"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
        }
    ],
```
4. in this case we can use the gbd launch to set up values in our program. Usually these are filled with the directories of the program we want to debug and our debugger path
5. once this is set up, you can run your debugger by choosing a breakpoint, a particular line for your program to halt the thread and be able to execute your code line by line. 
6. on the left you can view your variables and how they change over time, you can also **pin** them by setting them to <ins>watch</ins>
7. ***HAPPY DEBUGGING***
