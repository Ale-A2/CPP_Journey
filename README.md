# C-HowTo
As I go in my C++ review journey, I will encounter errors in syntax, logic, arithmetic, etc. 
This repository will be dedicated to documenting my mistakes, the solutions, and my process to arrive to solution.
The goals is to achieve better documentation and have a reference whenever I come back to review C++
